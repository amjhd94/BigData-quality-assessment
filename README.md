# Big Data Quality Assessment
### Parallel exploration algorithms to identify the most informative subsets of large datasets and eliminate redundancy
Exploration is done to identfy the smallest subset of the data with which a deep neural network model could be trained such that it captures the rare extreme events and tipping points, and minimizes the overal uncertainty of the model predictions and mean squared error (MSE).

The code "BigDataQualityAssessment_ActiveSampling.py" contains a quick demo of how the algorithms work.
